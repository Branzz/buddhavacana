Hello world!

I would like announce a new website, which will probably be a work of progress until I die, called **buddhavacana** (The Word of the Buddha).

This website documents my journey reading and studying Buddhist texts, primarily from the Pāli Canon (Tipiṭaka) but also supplementary books and articles. My intent is to rely as much on the original Pāli terms and text where possible, and only rely on English translations as an interim aid to understanding.

The initial release features minimum content, relating to some summaries of key concepts from the Basket of Discourses (Sutta Piṭaka) and some Pāli language reference materials. I hope to eventually cover the Basket of Higher Doctrine (Abhidhamma Piṭaka) as well, but probably will not cover much material from the Basket of Monastic Law (Vinaya Piṭaka).
